Activity 2 - Seaspan Scheduling Visualization
=============================================

Our design for this problem is a bar chart visualization of the sailing times of each route as the x axis the average load as the y axis, each bar is coloured to signify the different vessels. There would be options to toggle one or many different routes which can be overlayed to show the vessels that span different routes and also options for changing the time period that is used to calculate the average load. 

We will assume there is recent and accurate load data available dating back several months or years. 

## What

Data:

* Vessels: These are **items**.
* Schedule: This is the **item** made up of routes and sailing times.
* Routes: These are **categorical attributes** of a schedule.
* Departure and arrival (sailing) times: These are **cyclic** and **quantitative ordered attributes** of the schedule.
* Load for each sailing: **quantitative, sequential ordered attributes** of a vessel.

## Why

Action: 

* Analyze 
    - Tool will be presenting data to discover patterns and correlations between average load on route schedules
