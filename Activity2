Activity 2 - Seaspan Scheduling Visualization
=============================================

Our design for this problem is a 'schedule view' calendar style visualization of each route with a bar chart for each sailing that displays average load. There would be options to toggle to different routes and for changing the duration that is used to calculate the average load. 

We will assume there is recent and accurate load data available dating back several months or years. 

## What

Data:

* Vessels 
* Routes 
* Departure and arrival time 

## Why

Action: 

* Analyze 
    - Tool will be presenting data to discover patterns and correlations between average load on route schedules 

Target:
